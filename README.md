This is a project on Diffie-Hellman key Exchange in Multiplicative and Elliptic Curve group on field Z_p.
I have implemented the finite field arithmetics on finite field which is base of DHKEX.
During key exchange each party will do those computation locally prior to the key exchange.
The whole code is implemented in basic C language with minimum no of library used. Refer to documentation pdf for better understanding.
